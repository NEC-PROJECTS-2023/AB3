Introduction:

BigMart is a popular retail chain that offers a wide  range of products across different locations. In this project, we will perform predictive analysis of BigMart sales using machine learning techniques. Our goal is to build a model that can accurately predict sales based on various factors such as store size, location, product type, and promotional activities. We will begin by exploring and preprocessing the dataset, which contains historical sales data for over 1,500 BigMart stores. We will use various techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues. We will also perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the relationships between different variables and their impact on sales. Next, we will use supervised learning algorithms such as linear regression,multiple regression,random forest regression to build models that can predict sales. We will use techniques such as cross validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of each model. We will evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared, and root mean squared error. We will also perform feature selection and feature engineering to identify the most important variables that affect sales. Finally, we will interpret the results and provide recommendations to the BigMart management team based on the insights gained from the analysis. Our project aims to provide a data-driven approach to improve sales and profitability for BigMart stores.
